/**
 * Ridge Regression. When the predictor variables are highly correlated amongst
 * themselves, the coefficients of the resulting least squares fit may be very
 * imprecise. By allowing a small amount of bias in the estimates, more
 * reasonable coefficients may often be obtained. Ridge regression is one
 * method to address these issues. Often, small amounts of bias lead to
 * dramatic reductions in the variance of the estimated model coefficients.
 * Ridge regression is such a technique which shrinks the regression
 * coefficients by imposing a penalty on their size. Ridge regression was
 * originally developed to overcome the singularity of the X'X matrix.
 * This matrix is perturbed so as to make its determinant appreciably
 * different from 0.
 * <p>
 * Ridge regression is a kind of Tikhonov regularization, which is the most
 * commonly used method of regularization of ill-posed problems. Another
 * interpretation of ridge regression is available through Bayesian estimation.
 * In this setting the belief that weight should be small is coded into a prior
 * distribution.
