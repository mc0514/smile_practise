/**
 * Power variogram
 * <p>
 * v(r) = c + &alpha; r<sup>&beta;</sup>
 * <p>
 * where &beta; is fixed and &alpha; is fitted by unweighted least squares
 * over all pairs of data points. The value of &beta; should be in the range
 * 1 &le; &beta; < 2. A good general choice is 1.5, but for functions with
 * a strong linear trend, we may experiment with values as large as 1.99.
 * <p>
 * The parameter c is the so-called nugget effect. Though the value of the
 * variogram for h = 0 is strictly 0, several factors, such as sampling error
 * and short scale variability, may cause sample values separated by extremely
 * small distances to be quite dissimilar. This causes a discontinuity at the
 * origin of the variogram. The vertical jump from the value of 0 at the origin
 * to the value of the variogram at extremely small separation distances is
 * called the nugget effect.
