/**
 * The signal-to-noise (S2N) metric ratio is a univariate feature ranking metric,
 * which can be used as a feature selection criterion for binary classification
 * problems. S2N is defined as |&mu;<sub>1</sub> - &mu;<sub>2</sub>| / (&sigma;<sub>1</sub> + &sigma;<sub>2</sub>),
 * where &mu;<sub>1</sub> and &mu;<sub>2</sub> are the mean value of the variable
 * in classes 1 and 2, respectively, and &sigma;<sub>1</sub> and &sigma;<sub>2</sub>
 * are the standard deviations of the variable in classes 1 and 2, respectively.
 * Clearly, features with larger S2N ratios are better for classification.
