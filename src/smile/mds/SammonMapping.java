/**
 * The Sammon's mapping is an iterative technique for making interpoint
 * distances in the low-dimensional projection as close as possible to the
 * interpoint distances in the high-dimensional object. Two points close
 * together in the high-dimensional space should appear close together in the
 * projection, while two points far apart in the high dimensional space should
 * appear far apart in the projection. The Sammon's mapping is a special case of
 * metric least-square multidimensional scaling.
 * <p>
 * Ideally when we project from a high dimensional space to a low dimensional
 * space the image would be geometrically congruent to the original figure.
 * This is called an isometric projection. Unfortunately it is rarely possible
 * to isometrically project objects down into lower dimensional spaces. Instead of
 * trying to achieve equality between corresponding inter-point distances we
 * can minimize the difference between corresponding inter-point distances.
 * This is one goal of the Sammon's mapping algorithm. A second goal of the Sammon's
 * mapping algorithm is to preserve the topology as best as possible by giving
 * greater emphasize to smaller interpoint distances. The Sammon's mapping
 * algorithm has the advantage that whenever it is possible to isometrically
 * project an object into a lower dimensional space it will be isometrically
 * projected into the lower dimensional space. But whenever an object cannot
 * be projected down isometrically the Sammon's mapping projects it down to reduce
 * the distortion in interpoint distances and to limit the change in the
 * topology of the object.
 * <p>
 * The projection cannot be solved in a closed form and may be found by an
 * iterative algorithm such as gradient descent suggested by Sammon. Kohonen
 * also provides a heuristic that is simple and works reasonably well.
