/**
 * Student's t test. A t-test is any statistical hypothesis test in which the test statistic has
 * a Student's t distribution if the null hypothesis is true. It is applied
 * when the population is assumed to be normally distributed but the sample
 * sizes are small enough that the statistic on which inference is based is
 * not normally distributed because it relies on an uncertain estimate of
 * standard deviation rather than on a precisely known value.
 * <p>
 * Among the most frequently used t tests are:
 * <ul>
 * <li> A test of whether the mean of a normally distributed population has
 * a value specified in a null hypothesis.
 * <li> A test of the null hypothesis that the means of two normally
 * distributed populations are equal. Given two data sets, each characterized
 * by its mean, standard deviation and number of data points, we can use some
 * kind of t test to determine whether the means are distinct, provided that
 * the underlying distributions can be assumed to be normal. All such tests
 * are usually called Student's t tests, though strictly speaking that name
 * should only be used if the variances of the two populations are also assumed
 * to be equal; the form of the test used when this assumption is dropped is
 * sometimes called Welch's t test. There are different versions of the t test
 * depending on whether the two samples are
 * <ul>
 * <li> unpaired, independent of each other (e.g., individuals randomly
 * assigned into two groups, measured after an intervention and compared
 * with the other group),
 * <li>or paired, so that each member of one sample has a unique relationship
 * with a particular member of the other sample (e.g., the same people measured
 * before and after an intervention).
 * </ul>
 * If the calculated p-value is below the threshold chosen for
 * statistical significance (usually 0.05 or 0.01 level), then
 * the null hypothesis which usually states that the two groups do not differ
 * is rejected in favor of an alternative hypothesis, which typically states
 * that the groups do differ.
 * <li> A test of whether the slope of a regression line differs significantly
 * from 0.
 * </ul>
